                Preparing for Industry</h1>
                <p class="banner-subtitle" style="height: 0;opacity: 0;">I am a student majoring in Visual Communication and am currently transitioning into the fields of Interaction Design and
                Digital Experience.
                During my course studies, I completed several research-oriented and user-centered projects, including a prototype of an
                emotional health application and an interactive installation concept. This career plan is presented in the form of a
                website, as it reflects how interaction designers convey their ideas - through clear hierarchical structures, intuitive
                navigation, and user-centered information flow. Therefore, it is not only a communication tool but also a practical
                showcase of my developing design identity.</p>

                                Interaction design lies at the intersection of user
                                research, interface design, psychology, and
                                technology. Current international reports show that
                                the UX/interaction industry is moving from “visual
                                interface decoration” toward experience
                                architecture, emphasizing evidence-based iteration,
                                accessibility, and emotional experience design (UX
                                Collective, 2023). This also aligns with China’s
                                product and service ecosystem, where multi-platform
                                integration across app/web/miniprogram/HMI is
                                becoming dominant.

                            The key points lie in designing the system, achieving cross-platform consistency, and conducting large-scale user

                            It indicates that the industry is paying more attention to user behavior, emotions and personalized experiences.</p>

                                AI may replace simple tasks; economic changes may reduce hiring; hybrid designers can

                        <h1>Why this industry</h1>
                        <h3>Three reasons:</h3>
                        <p>1.Impact at scale. Interaction design shapes daily
                            behaviours across commerce, healthcare,
                            education and public services. Small interface
                            decisions compound into measurable
                            outcomes.<br />
                            2.Problemsolver × systemsbuilder fit. The work
                            rewards clear thinking, structured iteration
                            and componentised delivery—exactly the habit<br />
                            3.China’s multiplatform landscape. Designing
                            consistently across app/web/miniprogram/HMI
                            offers rich problems where research evidence and
                            designsystem thinking matter.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="industry-text">
                        <h1>My connection with this industry</h1>
                        <h3>Three points:</h3>
                        <p>1.Clear purpose. I believe great technology should feel simple. Seeing many products confuse
                            users pushed me toward
                            interaction design—building a clearer, more human bridge between people and
                            technology.<br />
                            2.Good fit with my strengths. I think in systems and have strong empathy. In an
                            emotional-experience project, I rebuilt
                            the information structure and helped users complete key tasks 30% faster. I work from
                            concept to prototype, use Figma
                            well, and iterate with data and testing.<br />
                            3.Growing with the field. Interaction design is expanding from screens to voice, AR/VR and
                            service systems. The
                            interdisciplinary, fast-evolving nature fits my curiosity and keeps me motivated to learn
                            and collaborate.</p>

                        My understanding of UX/interaction design careers has been shaped by industry research and
                        discussions with professionals. According to The Futureplex (2024), the next five years will see
                        increasing demand for in-house designers who can collaborate deeply with product and engineering
                        teams, while agencies will remain hubs for fast-paced creativity. This directly supports my
                        decision to pursue in-house roles at this stage.

                    <h2>Agency</h2>
                    <p>Industry insights suggest agencies offer broad exposure and rapid iteration skills but often
                        involve high pressure and
                        fragmented projects (UX Collective, 2023). This confirms my own experience: agency-style work
                        helps me grow quickly, but
                        not sustainably at this stage.</p>

                                Interviewee Background:<br/>
                                7 years of experience in interaction design, having worked at Alibaba and ByteDance, responsible for multi-platform
                                products (App/Web/Mini Programs).<br/>
                                “Today's interaction designers are no longer just interface drawers. Companies need people who can comprehensively
                                consider business goals, user research, and technical constraints. You need to be able to explain clearly: Why is it
                                designed this way? What results will it bring? This is more important than being able to make prototypes.”<br />
                                “If you take the in-house route, you must understand data. A designer who can't tell a story with data won't last in
                                today's teams.”

                                The Futureplex (2024) suggests that freelance UX roles will grow, but require strong
                                personal branding, business operations, and network building. This aligns with my long-term plan
                                but not my short-term capability.

                                Respondent background:<br />
                                A freelance UX/UI designer with 5 years of experience, having long been involved in SaaS projects in the health and
                                education sectors.<br />
                                "Freelancing is not freedom; it's doing all the tasks yourself. You are simultaneously working as a PM, BD
                                representative, Designer, Finance officer, and Researcher."<br />
                                "The advantage of being a freelancer is that you can choose your own field of work. For example, I only do healthcare
                                and education. This way, it's easier for me to be recognized in the market."<br />
                                "If you aspire to become a hybrid designer in the future, you must have an anchor domain - such as healing, travel, or
                                learning."
